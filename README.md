# Image Classification with CNN

## Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or MNIST). The goal is to develop a deep learning model for image recognition.

## Objectives:
- Build an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Classify images into different categories (e.g., cars, birds).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- CNN

## Key Insights
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying images into categories.
- Used CNN architecture to automatically extract features from images.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the CNN model on image data.
